# Forward-A-Sent-Gmail
Automate forwarding any message in Gmail that is marked with the label “Sendmail.” You can replace sendmail with any other value and set it up to forward just about any email you send to another address. The key is that all of the messages you want to send automatically need to be tagged with that label or whatever label you change “Sendmail” to.
